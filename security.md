Top_of_page Medidata controls data security using authentication and authorization.

- Authentication identifies users and applications.
- Authorization determines what authenticated users or applications can do in the platform when they have access to the data or workflow.

The Medidata platform links but keeps distinct authorization and authentication. Medidata APIs implement security logic locally; that is, the platform does NOT defer the processes to the client.

# HTTPS Security

Medidata API services only accept HTTPS TLS v1.2 connections or above. _authenticate

Medidata systems authenticate all requests using the Medidata authentication protocol on top of HTTPS. The easiest way to authenticate API requests is by way of the authentication clients that Medidata offers. _client

# Set Up the Client

> **Note**

> **Important:** If you use mAuth to authenticate Rave Web Services requests, you must use mAuth v1. Reach out to your Medidata representative for more information.
